                    "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" is based on the Marvel Comics storyline of the same name, "Spider-Verse," which was published in 2014. The film takes inspiration from this comic book series but also incorporates elements and characters from various Spider-Man comic books over the years.
                    In the "Spider-Verse" comic book storyline, multiple versions of Spider-People from different dimensions and universes come together to combat a common threat. While the movie draws heavily from this comic event, it also introduces its own narrative elements and unique visual style to create a distinctive cinematic experience.
